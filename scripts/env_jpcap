# This script sets up required paths for jpcap development.
#
# NOTE: 
#   You must have a JDK (v1.2 or later) installed before running this script.
#   A Java compiler should be in your path. The build process relies on 
#   the environment variable JAVA_HOME in order to locate native headers.
#
#   If these aren't already in your shell environment, execute something like:
#     export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.3 ; export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
#
#   Futher customize this script by changing PROJECT_HOME and RELEASE_HOME.
#

# change to the location in your workspace where jpcap is checked out..
export PROJECT_HOME=~/dev/github/jpcap

# NOTE: Windows users, with MinGW, '~/' doesn't work in CLASSPATH. Instead:
#export PROJECT_HOME=/home/$USERNAME/dev/sourceforge/jpcap

# change to point to the location where built distributions will be placed..
export RELEASE_HOME=~/dev/releases

# NOTE: Windows users must specify path to WinPcap.
#export WINPCAP_HOME=/c/WpdPack
